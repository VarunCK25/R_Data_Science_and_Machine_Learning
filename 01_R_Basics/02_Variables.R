#@@@ VARIABLES @@@

# Let's go over how to assign variables in R.

# We can use the <- character to assign a variable, note how it kind of looks like an arrow pointing from the object to the variable name.

# Use hashtags for comments
variable.name <- 100

# Let's see the variable!
print(variable.name)

# --------------------------------------------------- #

## Working with variables

# We can use variables together and work with them, for example:

bank.account <- 100

deposit <- 10

bank.account <- bank.account + deposit

print(bank.account)
